# Sticky-Keys
Sticky Keys is a word game developed by Aayush Gaywala, Kevin Chang, and Rishabh Bhargava from Homestead High School in Cupertino, California for FBLA CGS.

The goal is to collect letters and make words from them. There are two phases, the letter hunt phase and the word hunt phase.

In the letter hunt phase, the player can move around the arena, acquire letters to adhere to the player, and attach them for the word hunt phase. Use WASD to move around and shift to attach letters to the player.

In the word hunt phase, letters are typed in to create words. Employ the keyboard to input words that can be made from the letters collected in the previous phase.

To run the game, download the game and extract the executable file.
